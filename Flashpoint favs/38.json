	"description": "For this list I've put Flash games that I mostly come back to year after year to play again, which I think is a real show of quality for a free web game. I have played all of these games multiple times over many years and I hope that continues long past Adobe's manhandling of the Flash plugin. It's in no particular order and I wouldn't rank any as being 'the best'. I love hundreds of Flash games but I limited myself to 10 (or so) slots that might not be on every other game list ever.\n\n(Editor's note: Antony Lavelle created some of Flash's most popular games under the 'Tony' moniker, including the SHIFT, Indestructotank and Upgrade Complete series)",

It captured a lot of what I loved about Zelda 2 while being casual enough to not raise my blood pressure in the same way. I worked with the author of this game several times after playing this game, and he released a large scale sequel on Steam later on. I still love the original though for its simple drop in and have fun and complete in one sitting nature.",
